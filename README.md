 and Power Bi# Tableau-and-Power-Bi-Space-Mission


This project revolves around space analytics, employing the Tableau and Power BI software to craft visualizations and dashboards. The attached files include the original Tableau document housed in the Tableau folder, as well as PDF and Word files encompassing all visualizations generated throughout the analysis. 

The dataset utilized for this analysis is located in the dataset folder. I have supplied two files: one is the primary data file, and the other is a metadata file.
